# References Component

The references component format is as follow:

```html
<div id="references" class="references">
  <sl-divider></sl-divider>
  <h2>References</h2>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

The only part that you should modifi is between the `<ul>` tag. You simply just need to add an entry as follows:

```html
<li>
    your reference entry
</li>
```

in between the `<ul>` tag as shown above and you are good to.
